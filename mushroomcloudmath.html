        <p>A <s>fun and interesting</s> guide to the math and setup of a mushroom cloud.</p>
        <hr>
        <p>
            The Mushroom Cloud can be split into <s>3</s> 2 parts:
            <li>The swrily vortex part, lets call it 'A'.</li> 
            <li>The shaft thingy, lets call it 'B'.</li><br>
            Now we can focus on each part separately and then glue em' together
            later.
        </p>
        <h2>Part A: THE PILLAR OF SMOKE</h2>
        <p>
            This 'pillar' must acclomplish two things: curving up, and rising
            up. This curve can be modeled quite simply really:
            3^(2x-3)
        </p>
        <div class="imgcap">
            <img src="assets/img/32x3.png" style="height: 25em;">
            <p>Graph of the function. As you can tell the smoke particle(s)
                would start off at a smooth rate and then basically go
                vertical.
            </p>
        </div>
        <p>And thats it! As in the basic motion is done. You dont want to have
            to deal with the logistics of creating particles constantly to
            keep the pillar going. Instead, create a variable like:
        </p>
        <div class="codecont">
            <p><oc>private int </oc>elapsedTicks<wc>;</wc></p>
        </div>
    </body>
